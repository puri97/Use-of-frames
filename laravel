Laravel is a free, open-source[4] PHP web framework, created by Taylor<br>
 Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following <br>
 the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Some of the<br>
 features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated <br>
 dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases,<br>
 utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its<br> orientation toward syntactic sugar.

As of March 2015, Laravel is regarded as one of the most popular PHP<br>
 frameworks, together with Symfony, CodeIgniter, Yii2 and others.<br>
The source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of MIT License.
