XAMPP (/ˈzæmp/ or /ˈɛks.æmp/[2]) is a free and open source cross-platform <br>web
 server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends,[2]<br> consisting mainly
 of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and<br>
 interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.<br>
 [3][4] XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P)<br>
 and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it <br>
 extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and <br>
 deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application<br>
 (Apache), database (MariaDB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in an <br>
 extractable file. XAMPP is also cross-platform, which means it works equally well<br>
 on Linux, Mac and Windows. Since most actual web server deployments use the same<br>
 components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server extremely easy as well.
